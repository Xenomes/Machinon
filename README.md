## Cache problems:

A lot of the problems users experience after a Domoticz update are gone when the browsercache and appcache are cleared. There are also quite a number of posts on this forum related to these kind of problems.

To summarize and sorted from little effort to a bit more effort take these steps and check after each step if it address the issues you encounter.

- First, go to Setup / Parameters / Theme and Click on Reset button and Clear Borwser Cache. If not enought, retry with the Reset Theme button.

- Clear browser cache and appcache 
Chrome: chrome://appcache-internals/#
Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/storage 

- In www/js look for domoticz.js.gz, if its there remove it, (KEEP domoticz.js !! )
- Use incognito mode using 
Chrome [control] [shift] n
Firefox: [control] [shift] p

- Restart domoticz
- Rename the location of the original installation and install the new version to an empty target directory. Next copy database and scripts from the old location and fire it up.
